If you want to dig deep into the world that Orgdio envisions and how it plans to get there, you are in the right place!

## The Challenges 
In this section you will find links to content that informs the challenge we are trying to solve: the end state for most companies, no matter how stable they might seem, is death.

## The Solution Ideas

There are many great works that shine a light on how we we might structure our companies to avoid or solve for the challenges listed above.  Just as a tip for the videos below, you can generally skip about half way through them because they are all essentially starting with trying to convince you of the same problem/challenge, which has been outlined above.

* Frederick Laloux's Reinventing Organizations. This work posits that there have been different paradigms in which human organizations have operated in over the history of humanity.  These paradigms range from a "red organization" which operates like a wolf-pack with a single alpha-wolf to an "orange organization" which operates in a very traiditional top-down hierarchy.  Frederick states that a new paradigm for organizations is emerging currently, which he dubs a "teal organization".  Teal organizations are run on the concepts of self-organization, wholeness, and evolutionary purpose. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk).
