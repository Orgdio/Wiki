<!-- TITLE: John Bunch -->


John Bunch was born and raised in Tallahassee, FL.  He completed his undergraduate studies at Georgia Institute of Technology with a B.S. In Computer Science and later received an M.S. In Computer Science from UNLV.  John joined Zappos.com in 2009 as a Software Developer after trying out High School math teaching and professional poker playing.  He moved on to lead the Public API team and subsequently transitioned into the role of Technical Advisor to Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh.  

During his time as Tony’s Advisor, there was a lot of thought being done about the direction and vision of Zappos.  Zappos had grown from a small start-up to a company of 1500 people and there was the sense that changes Zappos used to be able to make quickly had become difficult to execute on.  Research from Triumph of the City inspired what would become the company’s direction.  The research showed that every time the size of a city doubles productivity per resident goes up by 15%, but actually the exact opposite thing happens in companies – as they grow they become less productive on a per employee basis.  This lead Zappos to question how it could operate more like a city and less like a traditional company.  John has been integral to helping Zappos explore this direction since 2013.

John led Zappos transition away from traditional hierarchy and to Holacracy, a flexible organization structure that moves more autonomy to teams and individuals.  Coming out of the rollout of Holacracy, John transitioned to leading internal infrastructure and systems.  Such systems include helping Zappos with decentralized flexible resource allocation, internal role marketplaces, and effective leveraging of productivity tools such as Asana, Slack, and GTD.

In 2015, John co-founded Thoughtful Org Partners with Alexis Gonzales-Black to help organizations discover how new orgainzational models could help improve their business operations, innovation, and resiliancy.

John is a thought leader in the self-organization space and his work Beyond the Holacracy Hype – The overwrought claims and the actual promise of the next generation of self-managed teams was recently published in Harvard Business Review.  John was recently named by LinkedIn as one of the Top Professionals Under 35 in their annual Next Wave award.
