In the Organization design world there is a lot out there and a lot left to be discovered.  It can leave you overwhelmed, confuesed, and over your head.  Enter Orgdio. Orgdio is an open-source community of org-design professionals that create modules that are then evolved and validated by clients and org-design professionals.  This allows us to have a flexiable arsenal that can be dialed up or dialed down to strengthen any organization.
