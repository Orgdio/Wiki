## Operational: Meeting Module

This module is intended to provide a robust set of options for teams that are looking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operational meetings.  

Each of the sections below can be added and removed in a plug-and-play fashion.  The group should have an agreed upon process, person, or role that has the authority to make decisions about which sections are to be included for the group.

Each group should have a person identified as the facilitator of the meeting who is responsible for running the groups prescribed sections and ensure the meeting concludes on time.

Each group should also have a person who will capture any formal outputs of the meeting.

Sections

IceBreaker

The icebreaker section is intended to build camaraderie among the group and to get all participants in a good mental space to engage for the rest of the meeting.  The designated facilitator of the group has the ability to run the icebreaker section in the way he/she thinks is best.  A few potential options are outlined below.  The facilitator may choose to run it the same way every meeting or switch it up.
