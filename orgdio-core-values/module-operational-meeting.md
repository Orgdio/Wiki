# Module: Operational Meeting

This module is intended to provide a robust set of options for teams that are looking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operational meetings.  

Each of the sections below can be added and removed in a plug-and-play fashion.  The group should have an agreed upon process, person, or role that has the authority to make decisions about which sections are to be included for the group.

Each group should have a person identified as the facilitator of the meeting who is responsible for running the groups prescribed sections and ensure the meeting concludes on time.

Each group should also have a person who will capture any formal outputs of the meeting.

### Sections


#### IceBreaker


The icebreaker section is intended to build camaraderie among the group and to get all participants in a good mental space to engage for the rest of the meeting.  The designated facilitator of the group has the ability to run the icebreaker section in the way he/she thinks is best.  A few potential options are outlined below.  The facilitator may choose to run it the same way every meeting or switch it up.

* Biggest Win/Biggest Challenge:  Each person in the group shares his biggest win since the last time the group met and his biggest current challenge.
* General Check-in:  Each person is given time to give a personal update about what has been going on in her life, anything that might be distracting her during the meeting, her mental state (happy, sad, tired, energized), or really anything she would like to share.  Small discussion is allowed, but the facilitator should take care that this round does not take more than a few minutes.  
* Fist of Five:  The facilitator asks a series of questions that are designed to be a quick gauge of sentiment within the group.  Everyone on the group responds by displaying a 1 to 5 fingers where 1 is bad and 5 is good.  Here are some potential questions:
    * How awake are you right now?
    * How energized are you about your work in this group?
    * How able do you feel you are to energize your work currently? (1 means you are completely blocked/stifled, 5 means you have a completely clear path ahead)

This section bookends the meeting and allows people a quick place to reflect.  Similar to the *Icebreaker* section, the designated facilitator of the group has the ability to run the icebreaker section in the way he thinks is best.    The facilitator may choose to run it the same way every meeting or switch it up. A few potential options are outlined below:

* Lauds: Each person shares one laud â€” a quick bit of praise for somebody in the group about something they saw in the meeting or something the person achieved recently.
* General Closing:  Each person is given time to give a quick reflection on what she liked and what opportunities she senses to improve the meeting going forward.  Small discussion is allowed, but the facilitator should take care that this round does not take more than a few minutes.  
* Fist of Five:  The facilitator asks a series of questions that are designed to be a quick gauge of sentiment within the group.  Everyone on the group responds by displaying a 1 to 5 fingers where 1 is bad and 5 is good.  Here are some potential questions:
    * I feel like this meeting was a good use of my time.
    * This meeting felt more productive than the way we used to do meetings.
    * This meeting helped me make progress on some of my work.
