<!-- TITLE: Orgdio Core Values -->

## Core Value #1: Purpose Driven

Everything should start with a purpose.  As a community, our purpose is currently defined as follows: 1) To create an open platform that any organization can use and adapt to help that organization transform itself into a better, stronger, and more resilient organization and 2) to create a community of experts to deliver this platform to the world.

## Core Value #2: Evolve

In order for our platform and the community to be as dynamic and successful as possible, we must be steadfast in constantly evolving to achieve our purpose.  We do not believe in one “right” solution, but rather, we are confident that we can co-discover and co-develop an organizational platform that can benefit any organization, regardless of its current structure.

We seek to create methodologies for any community member to propose a change to the platform, to evaluate the level of success of the proposed change, and to select (as a community) those elements of the platform which are considered to optimal.

We believe evolution applies to the totality of an organization and therefore even our core values are also submitted to this process.

## Core Value #3: Community Focused

We seek to build a community composed of: 1) of experts on the Orgd.io platform and 2) organizations that use elements of the Orgd.io platform.  The community will be built on the tenets of exploration, shared learning, inclusion, and gratitude.

## Core Value #4: Open Sourced and Self-Governed

We draw inspiration from the Open Source movement and the prodigious products that have been created as a result of its existence.  Every single piece of Orgd.io, from our governing structure to the content that makes up the platform, is subject to internal evolution and external use. 

Within the Open Source movement, there are many different methodologies for governing a project.  We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach for decision making within Orgd.io.  For example, some decisions may be owned very locally — such as determining what information to show on the Orgd.io website - and by contrast, others, such as a change the Orgd.io Core Values, may require a substantial majority (super-majority) of the community to approve a change.  As a guiding principle, we believe in the concept of trying to distribute as much authority as possible but also understand there are many decisions where this is not the best pathway.
