<!-- TITLE: Module: Decision Methodology Types -->

# Types
When creating a format for how decisions are made within an organization, multiple paradigms emerge. The following is a couple potential paradigms:

## Top Down

Top down is a paradigm where the top initially holds all decision making authority.  With an organization of any decent size this is immediately burdensome, creating the need to distribute authority to other groups/roles/individuals.  The act of distributing authority can be processed by the governance process of an organization. 

The distribution of authority can be narrow or broad.  How that authority is to be unpacked can also be governed by the group distributing the authority.

In general, groups should try to distribute as much authority as possible.  Not doing so will lead to a burdensome operation of an organization, where in order to take most actions a group will need to solicit approval or process a governance change.  The process of role distribution should be mindful of delegating overlapping authority.  For example, you grant the group in your organization that controls the website the authority of “Any decisions related to the website”.  You have previously given the authority of “Brand related messaging/content” to the group responsible for brand image.  In this situation, the new authority grant for the website could potentially overlap with the existing brand image authority.  If somebody wants to update the content on the “About Us” section of the website, who would decide what content to post — the brand group or the website group?  In this scenario, the governance process would be used again to create a tighter definition of the website authority grant.  Instead of “Any decisions related to the website,” the authority would be redefined to a grant of “The selection and administration of a website platform,” eliminating the conflict.  

## Bottom Up

Bottom up is a paradigm where all decision making authority is, by default, open to any group.  Given the complete openness of this setup, conflicts will naturally emerge between different groups as they unpack their purpose.  When such conflicts emerge they should be resolved via the organizations governance process.

As a new organization gets started with this process, its first priority should be to delegate authority in areas where not doing so could lead to irreparable harm.  For instance, putting a process in place for how groups can spend money/expend the company's resources is likely a good idea.  Without such a process any group could spend any amount of money they saw fit, which could lead to irreparable harm if a group spent so much as to put the organization in a bad financial situation.

# What should be included in a Decision Authority Grant?

## What (Required)

Define the decision making authority that is being granted and to what group.

This definition should be a clear as possible.  Prioritize clarity over brevity.

## How (Optional)

Unless specified, the group who is granted the decision making authority has the ability to self-govern how the grant is unpacked.  However, the group who is granting the authority can specify a specific methodology.  For example, a specific grant may require a majority vote of the group in order to make a decision, or, a grant may specify that a single individual, decided by the group, must hold the authority.  

## Term (Optional)

Unless specified, the term of the grant is indefinite and may be altered via the governance process of the granting group at any time.  The granting group may specify a term.  For example, a specific grant is given for exactly six months from the date of passage.  At the end of the term the grant is automatically rescinded and the governance returns to its previous status.  

## Examples

What: “The definition of an organization's core values.”
How: “A change to the organization's core values may be processed by a 2/3 majority of all members vote to affirm the new core values”
In this case the grant does not refer to a  specific group but rather the organization itself, given the voting methodology specified in the *how*.

What: “All decisions related to the organization's community practices are granted to the *Outreach* group”
Term: “6 months from the passage of this grant”
In this case the grant is being given to a group only for a specified amount of time.  The *How *is not defied, which means that the group who is granted the authority (*Outreach)* self-governs how this authority is unpacked.
